# Memory-Card-Game
Objective - To match all pairs of matching cards

In our memory game, there are two options for gameplay: easy and hard. Each difficulty level has its own number of hearts (wrong attempts).

Easy - 4 shapes - effectively 8 cards (since each shape appears twice).
Hard - 8 letters - effectively 16 cards.

If two identical cards are chosen, they will remain visible. If two different cards are chosen, it will count as a failure and the player will lose hearts.

During the game, the time for that game will appear, and when the game ends (loss/win), a message will pop up with the game data (win/loss, game time, remaining hearts).
